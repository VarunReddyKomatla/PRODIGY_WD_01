During my web development internship, I successfully developed an interactive navigation menu as my first task. 
This menu, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, dynamically changes its color and style upon scrolling or hovering over a menu item. It maintains a fixed position and remains visible across all pages.
I utilized HTML for the menu structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to implement interactivity, including altering the background or font color based on user interactions.
